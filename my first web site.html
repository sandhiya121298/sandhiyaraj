<p>The growing number of people on the planet and how we live <sup>H</sup>2<sup>O</sup> here co<sub>2</sub> is going to <b>determine</b> the future of nature. 
And the future of us. Nature will go on, no matter what. It will evolve. 
The question is, will it be with us or without us?
If nature could talk, it would <i>probably</i> say it doesn’t much matter ​either way. 
We must understand there are aspects of how our planet evolves that are <em>totally</em> out of our control. 
But there are <del>things</del> that we can manage, 
control and do responsibly that will <ins>be</ins> allow us and the planet to evolve together.</p>
